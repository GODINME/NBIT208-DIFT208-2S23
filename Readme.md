# NBIT 208 or DIFT 208 System Analysis and Design

* System Analysis and System Design are two stages of the software development life cycle. System Analysis is a process of collecting and analyzing the requirements of the system whereas System Design is a process of creating a design for the system to meet the requirements. Both are important stages as it helps to create an effective system with all the features and functions.

## What is System Analysis?
* System Analysis is a process of understanding the system requirements and its environment. It is one of the initial stages of the software development life cycle. System analysis is the process of breaking the system down into its individual components and understanding how each component interacts with the other components to accomplish the system’s overall goal. In this process, the analyst collects the requirements of the system and documents them.

## Characteristics 

* It is the study of the existing system to identify the problem areas.
* It is a process of understanding the system requirements and its environment.
* It involves gathering and understanding the user’s requirements.
* It involves analyzing the system in terms of its current and future needs.

## Advantages

* It helps to identify the problems and their causes.
* It helps to understand the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
* It helps to develop better solutions.
* It helps identify the areas of improvement.

## Limitations

* It can be time-consuming.
* It can be costly.
* It can be difficult to get accurate information.

## What is System Design?
* System Design is the process of creating a design for the system to meet the requirements. System design is the process of designing the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy the specified requirements. It involves the design of the system architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data.

## Characteristics

* It is the process of creating a design for the system.
* It involves the design of the system architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data.
* It involves identifying the modules and components of the system.
* It involves creating the user interface and database design.

## Advantages

* It helps to create an efficient system.
* It helps identify the areas of improvement.
* It helps to reduce the development cost.
* It helps to create a better user experience.

## Limitations

* It can be time-consuming.
* It can be costly.
* It can be difficult to get accurate information.

# Test Book
[System Design by Alex Xu](https://ugedugh-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/poffei_st_ug_edu_gh/ETS4c2NQ_bBAo0dLhx7GVlEB2bLwZ46oxDAJ_fAbQC5CxQ?e=X5dVw1)


## After the course a student hopefully will know:
* How to manage software requirements
* How to develop iteratively and incrementally
* How to think with objects, not procedures
* How to use design patterns and not use anti-patterns
* How to draw and share knowledge using UML
* How to choose and use data formats, e.g. XML or JSON
* How to choose a database management server
* How to deploy software continuously
* How to build distributed software systems
* How to test software
* How to measure the quality of software design

# They will also be able to:
* Document requirements in SRS and use cases
* Make key design decisions
* Explain them in UML
* Use and Organize repository in GitHub and Git
* Automate the build and cover it with tests
