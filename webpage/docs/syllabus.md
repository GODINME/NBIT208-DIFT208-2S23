# Course Syllabus
* System Analysis and System Design are two stages of the software development life cycle. System Analysis is a process of collecting and analyzing the requirements of the system whereas System Design is a process of creating a design for the system to meet the requirements. Both are important stages as it helps to create an effective system with all the features and functions.
